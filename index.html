    <p>
      As a collective we are a flat organization organized together to work on great projects for great people. Our
      unique organizational approach allows us to work more nimbly, at lower costs, with higher standards. While our
      design philosophies vary from ninja to ninja, we are bound by an equal obsession with quality. Quality is our
      northern star, and a job done well is how we sleep at night.
      <br>
      <br>
      Each project team is constructed uniquely with the individual client needs in mind from a group of best in class
      ninjas.
      We believe in properly aligned incentives and therefore have structured with a revenue share model, and don't
      require
      any ninja to work on
      a project that they did not opt into for themselves. Upon receiving a new project each available ninja is given
      the
      opportunity to "bid" on a role based on their individual skill set. The final team is then selected based on each
      ninjas personal abilities, and overall team fit. Each member of the project is then given equity in the
      projects revenue corresponding to their assigned role. <a href="#faq" class="sublink">Learn

    <span class="title">What makes someone a Ninja</span>
    <p>As flexibility is an integral part of our identity, it only makes sense that we withhold from defining a Ninja.
      For example we love both experts, and generalists as we know there is a time and place for both. We don't pretend
      to know everything and are open and welcome to new ideas and ways. That being said the following adjectives are
      qualities we value in each other: Communicative, Respectful, Responsible, Curious, Risk tolerant, and
      Enthusiastic.
      <br>
      <br>
      Some day we hope to open the opportunity for those without prior domain experience to join us, but for the time
      being we also require all members to have a demonstrated ability of working in one of our supported domains. Years
      of experience, degrees, or previous employers are interesting but we care far more about current ability!
      <br>

    <span class="title" id="how-organization-structured">How is the organization structured</span>
    <p>Ninjas are independent contractors who are paid a percentage of the revenue brought in from each project of which
      they are a part. The actual percent is determined on a project by project basis, but a full "cap table" is made
      available to all members of the team during the negotiation stage ensuring transparency and fairness. This revenue
      share model allows for ninjas to maintain other commitments, while joining projects on a merit basis.
      Additionally, we can simultaneously reduce client costs, while sharing more of the revenue directly with our
      ninjas. Win win win win.</p>
    <span class="title">How do ninjas join a project</span>
    <p>All ninjas who are thought to fit a role on a new project are made aware of the opportunity via the project
      organizer, whose role it is to assemble a team. Upon receiving this information a ninja can express interest in
      the role. After a specified period of time the project organizer will make known the details of the team and begin
      discussions with the team to ensure clarity on the scope, and terms of the project. This entire process should be
      a matter of days.</p>
    <span class="title" id="how-ninjas-selected">How are ninjas selected for a project</span>
    <p>When a ninja is designated for a role on a project, they become responsible for what ever that role might entail.
      This of course means we want to make sure beforehand that each ninja has the requisite skills, tools, and
      information required to succeed. Where the tools and information are a shared responsibility between all project
      members, the skills is one solely owned by the ninja themselves. To this point it becomes critical that each role
      is filled with the ninja best equipped skill wise for the role. Furthermore because the tools, and information are
      a shared responsibility among the team members we also must take team dynamics into account when constructing a
      team of 2 or more.</p>
    <span class="title">Can I meet the Ninja's</span>
    <p>The nature of our collective is to be transparent and evolving. Like a living organism we stay dynamic. Before
      signing any contracts you will have the opportunity to meet the members of your team. Each partner will have a
      voice and stake in the project. But fear not, we are well practiced in this process and will be sure to
      demonstrate what a breeze working with us is.</p>
    <span class="title">Do you have sample projects</span>
    <p>We understand how important it is to see past projects and that's why we do things a bit different. In the
      initial meeting with your team members, each ninja will elaborate on why they are a great fit for this project,
      and demonstrate any relevant past work that they have done. Like this you will get an honest representation of who
      your ninjas are and what they are capable of!</p>
